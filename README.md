Final school project designed to showcase my advanced GUI skills through the development of a comprehensive application. This project aims to demonstrate my expertise in creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces and is worth 25 study points.

# **Objective: Design and implement a unique GUI screen using WPF. The screen should meet the following criteria:**
**Required Controls:**
