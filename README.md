Final school project designed to showcase my advanced GUI skills through the development of a comprehensive application. This project aims to demonstrate my expertise in creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces and is worth 25 study points.

# **Objective: Design and implement a unique GUI screen using WPF. The screen should meet the following criteria:**
**Required Controls:**
- DatePicker
- CheckBox
- ListBox
- Calendar
- RadioButton
- ComboBox with items

**Additional Requirements:**
- Images: Include and properly place three images in the gui.
- Window Size: the window size must be 600 x 1000 p.
- Fonts: Use at least three diff fonts, including bold and italic styles.
- Text Formatting: Apply different text sizes.
- Colors: Use a variety of background and foreground colors with matching color schemes.
- Title: Display a relevant title in the top left corner of the window.
- Layout: The screen must be responsive and the controls should adjust logically with window resizing.

# My progress:

**Theme**
- For the idea I chose to go with a simple product management app for stores... I will add simple functionality to it.
- The theme was about Laptops.

**GUI Design**
- I have set up the left side bar that has everything needed for the left side bar.
